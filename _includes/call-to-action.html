                <p class="text-faded">
                    Reflecting upon my final Computer Science class, I am filled with a sense of accomplishment and growth. Throughout this course, 
                    I had the opportunity to enhance applications in three crucial categories: Software Design and Engineering, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Databases. 
                    Each category presented unique challenges, but I embraced them with enthusiasm and determination. In this self-assessment article, I will share my journey, 
                    the enhancements I made, the lessons learned, and the skills I acquired along the way.

                <p class="text-faded h3">Software Design and Engineering</p>
                <p class="text-faded">
                    For the Software Design and Engineering category, I chose to enhance a mobile applicationâ€”an Inventory Management app developed for Android. 
                    This project allowed me to showcase my skills in designing an intuitive and appealing user interface, as well as my proficiency in Java as the backend language. 
                    As I delved into the enhancements, I realized the importance of refining the user experience. Not only did I address planned improvements, such as implementing 
                    a Register page and key listeners, but I also took initiative to add essential features like preventing empty item saves and enforcing password complexity. 
                    The joy of transforming ideas into real-world applications was immensely rewarding, and I gained valuable experience in identifying and resolving issues efficiently.

                <p class="text-faded h3">Data Structures and Algorithms</p>
                <p class="text-faded">
                    In the Data Structures and Algorithms category, I worked on a console application that involved processing a large dataset. The application utilized a Binary Tree 
                    algorithm to map the data and provided functionalities like printing, searching, and deleting items. Enhancing this project enabled me to demonstrate my ability to 
                    interact with massive amounts of data and implement efficient algorithms. I significantly improved the search and deletion functionalities, empowering users to choose 
                    specific items for these operations. While this endeavor posed challenges, including troubleshooting and overcoming past knowledge gaps, I persisted and triumphed. 
                    By utilizing the BinarySearchTree algorithm and addressing performance issues, I met the objectives of this category and deepened my understanding of algorithmic principles.

                <p class="text-faded h3">Databases</p>
                <p class="text-faded">
                    In the Databases category, I revisited the same Inventory Management mobile application from a database perspective. I leveraged MySQL Lite as the database management program 
                    and focused on refining data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. One of the crucial enhancements I made was addressing a major security flaw: implementing password hashing 
                    and comparison during registration and login processes. Additionally, I improved code simplicity, resource management, and category sorting functionality. Though the process 
                    presented its challenges, such as incorporating external libraries, I overcame them through persistence and problem-solving. This experience expanded my skills in working with 
                    relational databases and reinforced the importance of data security.

                <p class="text-faded h3">Lessons Learned</p>
                <p class="text-faded">
                    Throughout this project, I learned valuable lessons that will shape my future as a computer scientist. Patience proved to be an essential virtue when faced with complex coding 
                    challenges. I discovered that estimating task durations is often optimistic, and it is crucial to allocate ample time for debugging, implementation, and unforeseen complexities. 
                    Furthermore, I realized the significance of embracing setbacks as opportunities for growth. The rewarding feeling that follows the resolution of issues encourages me to persevere 
                    and continuously seek improvement.

                <p class="text-faded h3">Conclusion</p>
                <p class="text-faded">
                    My journey of enhancing applications across different categories has been a remarkable experience. Through Software Design and Engineering, I showcased my ability to create 
                    intuitive user interfaces and manipulate data using Java. In Data Structures and Algorithms, I deepened my understanding of efficient algorithms and data processing techniques. 
                    Lastly, the Databases category allowed me to strengthen my skills in working with relational databases and prioritizing data security.
