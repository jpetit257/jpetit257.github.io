                The artifact chosen for this part of the course (software Design and Engineering) is a mobile application. To be more specific, it’s an Android mobile application. This mobile application was created to be an Inventory Management application, which was developed between September and October 2022 as part of the Mobile Application and Programming class. The language used to develop this application is Java and the IDE used is Android Studio
The inventory management app allows users to add, delete, update, and retrieve inventory through a user interface. This artifact was selected as it demonstrates my ability to create and design a user interface that is intuitive and appealing. It also demonstrates my ability to use Java as the backend language to manipulate user data using the CRUD operations.
I was fortunately able to meet the course objectives as far the enhancements to the applications are concern. I was even able to deliver more than what I promised. Among the things I planned on doing were:
1.	Creating a Register page that only appears only if there is no user in the DB.
2.	Removing link to the Register page from the Login page.
3.	Removing link to the Login page from the Register page.
4.	Adding key listeners for the Enter key on both Login and Register pages.
5.	Removing unused codes.
6.	Replacing hardcoded strings with reference to the String Resources.
In addition to those changes I was able to do two things that I did not plan for, but felt was necessary while I was enhancing and testing the app. These were:
•	Adding a check to prevent user from saving an empty item.
•	Requiring a complex password when registering a user as well as a detailed message when the password complexity is not met so the user knows exactly how to fix it.
The process of enhancing the application was really fun. I like how I go from identifying an issue, planning on how to fix it, coding the fix, and testing it. Then if it doesn’t work, loop through the process again and again until the issue is resolved, at which point it’s ok to go to the next issue. I never lose patience when I can’t figure things out. As a matter of fact, I think it causes me to find more joy when I finally find the fix. And seeing ideas turning into real-world applications that somebody could potentially use is a very rewarding feeling. I enjoy coding way more than even writing this.
But all that fun didn’t come with no challenge. I actually discovered a bug while testing. If you are in the username textbox and press the Enter key instead of Tabbing out of that field, it will break the line within the field and acts as if it was a multi-line text area. And since those fields are meant to only show one line, the data entered becomes hidden from view. I wanted to fix that not only to prevent that ugly UI issue from happening, but I also wanted the user experience to be better by allowing the user to use the enter key as the Tab key since there is no Tab button in the phone’s virtual keyboard. It took me a few hours to fix that minor issue alone. But at the end, I was so happy.
What I learned in this assignment on the other hand, is something I’ve been learning for some time now. It’s how to be patient when the solution seems to be eluding me.
