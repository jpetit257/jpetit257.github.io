                Code review is vital in the development life cycle as it provides numerous benefits. Firstly, it helps in identifying and resolving 
                issues early on, saving time and effort in the long run. It also improves code quality by ensuring adherence to standards and promoting 
                consistency and readability. Additionally, code review facilitates knowledge sharing and collaboration among developers, leading to 
                better solutions and skill enhancement. It plays a crucial role in risk mitigation by identifying vulnerabilities and performance issues. 
                Code review fosters a sense of code ownership, teamwork, and continuous improvement, ultimately resulting in more secure, 
                reliable, and efficient software.
