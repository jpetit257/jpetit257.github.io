                    Code review is vital in the development life cycle as it provides numerous benefits. Firstly, it helps in identifying and resolving 
                    issues early on, saving time and effort in the long run. It also improves code quality by ensuring adherence to standards and promoting 
                    consistency and readability. Additionally, code review facilitates knowledge sharing and collaboration among developers, leading to 
                    better solutions and skill enhancement. It plays a crucial role in risk mitigation by identifying vulnerabilities and performance issues. 
                    Code review fosters a sense of code ownership, teamwork, and continuous improvement, ultimately resulting in more secure, 
                    reliable, and efficient software.

                    In this code review video, I analyzed the mobile application code from an engineering and design perspective as well as from a database 
                    perspective. I was able to identified multiple issues. All the ones that were idenfied were fixed. But some others that did not jump to 
                    me in the code review were found while coding and fixed. Let's take a look at the video and see how I plan to tackle the issues identified.
